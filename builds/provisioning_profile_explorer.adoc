= Provisioning Profile Inspector

Buddybuild allows you to inspect the exact provisioning profile a
specific build was built with.

See exactly which devices are enabled, and the entitlements of your App.

Navigate to the build details page of a particular build and then click
on **View Details** under the **Code Signing and Versioning** section to
open the inspector.
