= Xcode Versions and Xcode Preview

All major versions of Xcode are available for use in buddybuild. The
beta versions for the latest Xcode release are also available.

== Selecting an Xcode Version

Start by clicking on **App Settings**.

**Xcode version** from the dropdown to change the default version for
your app.

You can set a different version of Xcode for a specific branch. To do
this scroll down to the **Branch-specific configurations** section, add
your branch and select the Xcode version. This allows you to easily
transition Xcode versions safely in a feature branch.

== Xcode Preview

When we release support for the latest Xcode version, we will
automatically select the last successfully built commit of your app and
build it with the latest version to see if it works. We'll let you know
if your app succeeds or fails with the latest version so that you can
  make informed decision before you decide to upgrade.

== Upgrade automatically

To keep your app up to date with the latest version of Xcode then you
can choose the `Latest` or `Latest stable` version from the Xcode
version dropdown.

If you select `Latest` then buddybuild will update your app to use the
latest version of Xcode (including beta releases) as soon as it is
released.

If you select `Latest stable` then buddybuild will update your app to
use the latest stable version of Xcode (not beta releases) as soon as it
is released.

We'll also send you a friendly notification when this happens so that
this is not a surprise.
