= GitHub Issues

GitHub Issues are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and
bugs for your projects. They’re kind of like email—except they can be
shared and discussed with the rest of your team.

Buddybuild can be configured to automatically open a GitHub issue for
each piece of feedback you receive on your app.

== Prerequisite

In order to create GitHub Issues on buddybuild, issue creation needs to
be enabled on GitHub.

[NOTE]
======
**Note:**

Issues are enabled by default for GitHub repositories.
======

You can check if issues are enabled by navigating to your app's
repository settings.

Next, configure GitHub Issues for Feedback and Crash Reports.  You can
automatically create issues, and choose to tag issues with custom labels
by filling in the "custom label" field.

That's it! buddybuild will now automatically open a GitHub issue on your
project for each piece of feedback and crash report you receive from
users of your app!
