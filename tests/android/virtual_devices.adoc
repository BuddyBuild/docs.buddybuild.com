======
**Why run UI tests on virtual devices?**

Depending on the set of tests, running UI tests on virtual devices might
lead to faster test runs. Virtual devices are created on-demand, and as
such, there is essentially no contention for a device resource.

Virtual devices are not charged per minute, so using virtual devices is
a good compromise in terms of speed, results and cost.
