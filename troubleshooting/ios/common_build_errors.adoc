= Common iOS build errors

We’ve put together a quick checklist to help teams troubleshoot the most
common causes for build failures.

Here's what you can to do quickly diagnose and likely resolve build
errors:

* Rebuild without cache
* Clone your repo and check if your app builds locally
* Share your schemes
* Ensure your tests pass
* Double check your third party dependencies

== Rebuild without cache

Caching is one of many techniques used by buddybuild to speed up build
times. However, some build failures can be caused by a corrupted or
out-of-date cache. Rebuilding without cache is a quick way to evict the
cache and rebuild from the most recent committed code.

To do this, select the build you’d like to rebuild, then navigate to the
build’s “Details” and click “Rebuild without Cache”.

=== Clone your repo and check if your app builds locally

It is important to make sure there are no discrepancies between your
remote branch and local git state.

Buddybuild creates a fresh clone of your code and executes build
commands on every commit.

Here's how to replicate this process and ensure your remote branch is up
to date:

* Clone your repo into a **new location / folder** on your machine

* Double check that you’re building the same target and scheme as
  identified in buddybuild

* Open Xcode from the new location and simply **⌘B** to build your app
  locally

Similarly, if you’re experiencing issues when using buddybuild to push
to iTunes Connect (for TestFlight or App Store deployments) make sure
you can Archive and Export your build locally as well.

In Xcode you can do this by navigating to **Product > Archive** then
select "**Export...**" and follow the onscreen instructions to finalize
exporting.

And finally, if your builds succeed locally but still fail on
buddybuild, run the same `xcodebuild` command from buddybuild on your
Mac to make sure that there are no discrepancies.

== Share your schemes

Sharing your schemes ensures buddybuild uses the correct build
configurations (like test targets) for your builds.

To share your scheme, open Xcode, select **Product > Scheme > Edit
Scheme…** (or **⌘<**) and choose the checkbox associated with the
schemes you’d like to share. 

NOTE: Make sure you commit and push the changes to your repo so
buddybuild can use them.

=== Ensure your tests pass

If your app has tests, make sure they run successfully on your Mac or
local machine.

If your tests are failing locally because of a known issue and you still
want to them to run in buddybuild, you can always opt to treat them as
warnings. This way failed tests won’t cause your builds to fail. To do
this go to your App Settings and enable the “Treat tests as warnings”
option.

== Double check your third party dependencies

=== CocoaPods

One of the most common causes of build failures is a Podfile.lock
missing from your repo. When using CocoaPods, the Podfile.lock specifies
the exact versions your app uses. Without the Podfile.lock, unexpected
versions of CocoaPods might be used during `pod install` on a new repo. 

Please double check the Podfile.lock is checked into your repo, as it
oftentimes is in `.gitignore`.

Alternatively, you can also check-in the entire Pods directory in your
repo. Buddybuild will detect checked-in pods, automatically skip the pod
install step, and use the Pods exactly as they’re setup locally.

In either case, run `pod install` locally, then commit and push the
changes to your repo.

=== Carthage

Make sure you set the Carthage version you use locally matches the one
specified in your app settings in buddybuild.

Also make sure that your `Cartfile` and your `Cartfile.resolved` are
checked into your repo.
